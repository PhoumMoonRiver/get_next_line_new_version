Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like the river flows
Shortly to the sea
Darling, so we go
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
Like the river flows
Shortly to the sea
Darling, so we go
Some things were meant to be, oh
Take my hand, take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love with you
